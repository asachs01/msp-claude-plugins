# Atera Claude Code Plugin

## Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Aaron / WYRE Technology
**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Status:** Draft
**Repository:** `atera/atera` (within msp-claude-plugins)
**Parent Project:** MSP Claude Plugin Marketplace

---

## Executive Summary

The Atera Claude Code Plugin provides comprehensive skills and commands for interacting with Atera, the all-in-one RMM, PSA, and remote access platform for MSPs. It enables Claude to assist with managing agents, tickets, devices, customers, and alerts across the Atera ecosystem.

The plugin leverages the `node-atera` library for API connectivity and follows the established plugin architecture pattern from the Autotask plugin.

---

## Problem Statement

Atera is a cloud-based RMM and PSA platform that combines remote monitoring, ticketing, and remote access in a unified interface. Technicians frequently need to:

- Check agent status and device health
- Create and manage support tickets
- Search for devices across customers
- Respond to and resolve alerts
- Access customer information quickly
- View device audit and inventory data

Without Claude skills for Atera, technicians must navigate the Atera console separately, reducing efficiency during troubleshooting and service delivery.

---

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Skills** — Cover all major Atera domains (agents, tickets, devices, customers, alerts, API patterns)
2. **Practical Commands** — Provide slash commands for common operations (lookup-agent, create-ticket, search-devices, resolve-alert)
3. **API Integration** — Integrate with node-atera library via MCP server
4. **Alert Management** — Enable efficient alert triage and resolution workflows
5. **Customer Context** — Provide quick access to customer and device relationships

## Atera-Specific Considerations

### Cloud-Native Platform
Atera is a fully cloud-based platform with:
- No on-premise server requirements
- Per-technician pricing model
- Built-in remote access (Splashtop)
- Integrated backup capabilities

### API Characteristics
- API v3 is the current version
- Simple API key authentication
- OData-style query support
- Well-documented at app.atera.com/apidocs
- Pagination uses nextLink pattern

### Alert Categories
The alerts skill must document all alert types:
- **Hardware**: Disk space, disk health, memory, CPU temperature
- **Software**: Service status, process monitoring, event log
- **Availability**: Device offline, ping failure
- **Security**: Antivirus status, firewall status
- **Patch**: Missing critical updates, missing all updates

### Common Workflows
1. **Alert Triage**: Review alerts, create tickets, resolve
2. **Device Lookup**: Find device, view specs, check alerts
3. **Customer Overview**: View customer devices, agents, open tickets
4. **Ticket Resolution**: Find related device, diagnose, resolve ticket
