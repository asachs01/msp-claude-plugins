# SuperOps Claude Code Plugin

## Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Aaron / WYRE Technology
**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Status:** Draft
**Repository:** `superops/superops` (within msp-claude-plugins)
**Parent Project:** MSP Claude Plugin Marketplace

---

## Executive Summary

The SuperOps Claude Code Plugin provides comprehensive skills and commands for interacting with SuperOps, the modern PSA-RMM platform built with AI capabilities. It enables Claude to assist with managing assets, tickets, clients, alerts, and knowledge base articles across the SuperOps platform.

The plugin leverages the `node-superops` library for API connectivity and follows the established plugin architecture pattern from the Autotask plugin. **Note:** SuperOps uses a GraphQL-based API, requiring different query patterns than REST-based platforms.

---

## Problem Statement

SuperOps is a next-generation unified PSA-RMM platform designed for modern MSPs, featuring AI-driven automation and a unified interface. Technicians frequently need to:

- Look up asset information and health status
- Create and manage support tickets
- Search for clients and their associated data
- Run automation runbooks
- Access knowledge base articles
- Respond to alerts and monitoring data

Without Claude skills for SuperOps, technicians must navigate the SuperOps interface separately, reducing the efficiency gains the platform is designed to provide.

---

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Skills** — Cover all major SuperOps domains (assets, tickets, clients, alerts, knowledge-base, API patterns)
2. **Practical Commands** — Provide slash commands for common operations (lookup-asset, create-ticket, search-clients, run-runbook)
3. **GraphQL Integration** — Properly document and leverage SuperOps GraphQL API patterns
4. **AI Alignment** — Complement SuperOps' built-in AI with Claude's capabilities
5. **Runbook Automation** — Enable automation workflows through runbook execution

## GraphQL API Patterns

### Query Examples

**Get Asset with Client**
```graphql
query GetAsset($id: ID!) {
  asset(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    serialNumber
    type
    status
    healthScore
    client {
      id
      name
    }
    lastSeen
  }
}
```

**List Client Tickets**
```graphql
query ClientTickets($clientId: ID!, $first: Int, $after: String) {
  client(id: $clientId) {
    tickets(first: $first, after: $after) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          number
          subject
          status
          priority
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mutation Examples

**Create Ticket**
```graphql
mutation CreateTicket($input: CreateTicketInput!) {
  createTicket(input: $input) {
    id
    number
    subject
    status
  }
}
```

**Execute Runbook**
```graphql
mutation ExecuteRunbook($input: ExecuteRunbookInput!) {
  executeRunbook(input: $input) {
    jobId
    status
    startedAt
  }
}
```

## SuperOps-Specific Considerations

### Modern Architecture
SuperOps is built as a modern, AI-first platform:
- GraphQL API (not REST)
- AI-powered features throughout
- Real-time updates via subscriptions
- Modern UI/UX design

### AI Integration
SuperOps has built-in AI that:
- Suggests ticket responses
- Auto-categorizes tickets
- Correlates alerts
- Provides asset health insights
Claude skills should complement, not duplicate, these features.

### Runbook Automation
Runbooks in SuperOps are powerful automation tools:
- Can execute scripts on assets
- Support parameters and variables
- Have scheduling capabilities
- Track execution history
