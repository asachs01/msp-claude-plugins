# Syncro Claude Code Plugin

## Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Aaron / WYRE Technology
**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Status:** Draft
**Repository:** `syncro/syncro` (within msp-claude-plugins)
**Parent Project:** MSP Claude Plugin Marketplace

---

## Executive Summary

The Syncro Claude Code Plugin provides comprehensive skills and commands for interacting with Syncro, the all-in-one PSA, RMM, and invoicing platform for MSPs. It enables Claude to assist with managing customers, tickets, assets, invoicing, and remote monitoring across the unified Syncro platform.

The plugin leverages the `node-syncro` library for API connectivity and follows the established plugin architecture pattern from the Autotask plugin.

---

## Problem Statement

Syncro is an integrated PSA/RMM platform designed specifically for MSPs, combining ticketing, customer management, asset tracking, invoicing, and remote monitoring in a single system. Technicians frequently need to:

- Look up customer details and contact information
- Create and manage support tickets
- Search and view asset/device information
- Access and create invoices
- Run scripts and manage RMM agents
- View alerts and monitoring data

Without Claude skills for Syncro, technicians must navigate the Syncro interface separately, reducing efficiency during service delivery and troubleshooting.

---

## Goals

1. **Comprehensive Skills** — Cover all major Syncro domains (customers, tickets, assets, invoicing, RMM, API patterns)
2. **Practical Commands** — Provide slash commands for common operations (lookup-customer, create-ticket, search-assets, get-invoice)
3. **API Integration** — Integrate with node-syncro library via MCP server
4. **Unified Platform** — Leverage Syncro's integrated PSA+RMM architecture for cross-domain workflows
5. **Invoice Automation** — Support invoice creation and management workflows

## Syncro-Specific Considerations

### Unified Platform
Syncro combines PSA and RMM in a single platform, which means:
- Assets and RMM agents are tightly integrated
- Tickets can be automatically linked to assets and alerts
- Invoicing is directly tied to time entries on tickets
- Customer records span both PSA and RMM contexts

### API Characteristics
- Simple REST API with API key authentication
- Subdomain-based multi-tenancy
- Good documentation at api-docs.syncromsp.com
- Webhooks available for event-driven integrations

### Common Workflows
1. **Alert to Ticket**: RMM alert triggers ticket creation
2. **Time to Invoice**: Ticket time entries flow to invoices
3. **Asset to Ticket**: Quick ticket creation from asset context
4. **Customer 360**: View all customer data (tickets, assets, invoices)
