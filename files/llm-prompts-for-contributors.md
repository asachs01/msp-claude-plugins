# LLM Prompts for MSP Plugin Development

These prompts are designed to help contributors use Claude (or other LLMs) effectively when building plugins for the MSP Claude Plugin Marketplace. The workflow is always: **PRD → Approval → Development**.

---

## 1. PRD Generation Prompt

Use this prompt first. Nothing gets built without an approved PRD.

```markdown
You are helping create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an MSP Claude plugin.

## Context
- **Vendor**: [e.g., Kaseya, ConnectWise, HaloPSA]
- **Product**: [e.g., Autotask, Manage, IT Glue]
- **Component/Feature**: [e.g., ticket management, company CRM, documentation sync]
- **API Documentation**: [paste link or note if unavailable]

## Your Task
Generate a complete PRD following this exact structure:

---
