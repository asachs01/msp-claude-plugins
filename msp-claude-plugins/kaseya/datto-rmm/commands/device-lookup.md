# Device Lookup

Find a device in Datto RMM by hostname, IP address, or MAC address.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Datto RMM API credentials configured
- `DATTO_API_KEY` and `DATTO_API_SECRET` environment variables set
- `DATTO_PLATFORM` configured (pinotage, merlot, concord, vidal, zinfandel, syrah)

## Steps

1. **Determine identifier type**
   - If matches IP format (e.g., `192.168.1.100`), search by IP
   - If matches MAC format (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`), search by MAC
   - Otherwise, search by hostname

2. **Fetch device list**
   - If site specified, use `/api/v2/site/{siteUid}/devices`
   - Otherwise, use `/api/v2/devices` with pagination

3. **Search devices**
   ```javascript
   // For hostname
   devices.filter(d =>
     d.hostname.toLowerCase().includes(identifier.toLowerCase())
   )

   // For IP address
   devices.filter(d =>
     d.intIpAddress === identifier || d.extIpAddress === identifier
   )

   // For MAC address
   devices.filter(d =>
     d.macAddresses?.some(mac => normalizeMAC(mac) === normalizeMAC(identifier))
   )
   ```

4. **Handle multiple matches**
   - If exact match found, return full details
   - If multiple partial matches, list them for user selection

5. **Fetch additional details for matched device**
   - Get device alerts: `GET /api/v2/device/{deviceUid}/alerts/open`
   - Get device audit (optional): `GET /api/v2/device/{deviceUid}/audit`

6. **Return device information**
   - Basic device details
   - Online/offline status
   - Open alert count
   - Site information
   - Last seen timestamp

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| identifier | string | Yes | - | Hostname, IP address, or MAC address |
| site | string | No | - | Filter by site name (partial match) |

## Examples

### Lookup by Hostname

```
/device-lookup "ACME-DC01"
```

### Lookup by Partial Hostname

```
/device-lookup "DC01"
```

### Lookup by IP Address

```
/device-lookup "192.168.1.100"
```

### Lookup by MAC Address

```
/device-lookup "00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
```

```
/device-lookup "00-1A-2B-3C-4D-5E"
```

### Lookup with Site Filter

```
/device-lookup "DC01" --site "Acme Corp"
```

## Output

### Single Device Found

```

### Multiple Matches Found

```
Multiple devices found matching "DC01":

  # | Hostname      | Site               | Status  | IP Address
----+---------------+--------------------+---------+---------------
  1 | ACME-DC01     | Acme Corporation   | Online  | 192.168.1.10
  2 | ACME-DC02     | Acme Corporation   | Online  | 192.168.1.11
  3 | TECHSTART-DC01| TechStart Inc      | Offline | 10.0.0.5

Specify a more precise identifier or use --site to filter.
```

### No Device Found

```
No device found matching "UNKNOWN-PC"

Suggestions:
- Verify the hostname/IP/MAC is correct
- Check if the device has the Datto agent installed
- Device may be in a different site - try without --site filter
```
