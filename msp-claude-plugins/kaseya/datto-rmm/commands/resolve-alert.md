# Resolve Alert

Resolve an open alert in Datto RMM by alert UID or by finding alerts on a device.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Datto RMM API credentials configured
- `DATTO_API_KEY` and `DATTO_API_SECRET` environment variables set
- `DATTO_PLATFORM` configured (pinotage, merlot, concord, vidal, zinfandel, syrah)

## Steps

1. **Determine identifier type**
   - If looks like a UUID (36 chars with dashes), treat as alert UID
   - Otherwise, treat as device hostname

2. **For alert UID:**
   - Directly resolve: `POST /api/v2/alert/{alertUid}/resolve`

3. **For device hostname:**
   - Find device using device lookup
   - Fetch open alerts: `GET /api/v2/device/{deviceUid}/alerts/open`
   - If single alert, resolve it
   - If multiple alerts, list them for selection (unless --all flag)

4. **Resolve alert(s)**
   ```http
   POST /api/v2/alert/{alertUid}/resolve
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "resolution": "Resolved by technician: <note>"
   }
   ```

5. **Confirm resolution**
   - Return success message with alert details
   - Show updated alert count for device

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| alert-id | string | Yes | - | Alert UID or device hostname |
| note | string | No | "Resolved via Claude" | Resolution note |
