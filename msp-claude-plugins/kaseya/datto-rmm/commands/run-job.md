# Run Job

Run a quick job (component script) on a device in Datto RMM.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Datto RMM API credentials configured
- `DATTO_API_KEY` and `DATTO_API_SECRET` environment variables set
- `DATTO_PLATFORM` configured (pinotage, merlot, concord, vidal, zinfandel, syrah)
- Device must be online for quick jobs
- Component must exist and be accessible

## Steps

1. **Resolve device identifier**
   - If UUID format, use as device UID directly
   - Otherwise, search by hostname using device lookup

2. **Verify device is online**
   - Check device status
   - If offline, return error with last seen time

3. **Resolve component**
   - If UUID format, use as component UID directly
   - Otherwise, search components by name

4. **Validate component variables**
   - Get component definition to check required variables
   - Verify all required variables are provided

5. **Create quick job**
   ```http
   POST /api/v2/device/{deviceUid}/quickjob
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "componentUid": "{componentUid}",
     "variables": {
       "key1": "value1",
       "key2": "value2"
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Handle result**
   - If `--wait` flag, poll for completion
   - Return job status and output

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| device | string | Yes | - | Device hostname or UID |
| component | string | Yes | - | Component name or UID |
| variables | string | No | - | Variables as `key=value,key2=value2` |
| wait | flag | No | false | Wait for job completion |

## Examples

### Basic Job Execution

```
/run-job "ACME-DC01" "Clear Temp Files"
```

### With Variables

```
/run-job "ACME-DC01" "Clear Temp Files" --variables "days=30,path=C:\\Temp"
```

### Wait for Completion

```
/run-job "ACME-DC01" "Clear Temp Files" --wait
```

### Using Component UID

```
/run-job "ACME-DC01" "c1d2e3f4-a5b6-7890-cdef-123456789abc" --wait
```

### Full Example

```
/run-job "ACME-DC01" "Disk Cleanup" --variables "drives=C,days=7,logs=true" --wait
```

## Output

### Job Queued (No Wait)

## Component Variable Format

Variables are passed as comma-separated `key=value` pairs:

```
--variables "key1=value1,key2=value2,key3=value3"
```

**Special Characters:**
- Use double quotes around the entire value
- Escape commas within values: `path=C:\Program Files\App`
- Boolean values: `true`, `false`
- Numbers: `30`, `100`

**Examples:**
```
--variables "days=30"
--variables "path=D:\\Backups,retention=7"
--variables "enabled=true,threshold=90,email=admin@company.com"
```
