# Autotask Contracts Management

## Overview

Contracts in Autotask define the service relationship with clients - what services you provide, how you bill for them, and what service levels apply. Contracts control how time and expenses flow to invoices and are critical for MSP financial management.

## Key Concepts

### Contract Types

| Type | Description | Billing Method |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Recurring Services** | Monthly/annual managed services | Fixed recurring fee |
| **Block Hours** | Prepaid hour bank | Deduct from balance |
| **Time & Materials** | Pay as you go | Bill actual time |
| **Fixed Price** | Project-based fixed fee | Milestone billing |
| **Retainer** | Prepaid monthly hours | Use or lose |

### Contract Fields

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `id` | Unique identifier | System |
| `contractName` | Contract name | Yes |
| `companyID` | Client company | Yes |
| `contractType` | Type of contract | Yes |
| `status` | Contract status | Yes |
| `startDate` | Contract start | Yes |
| `endDate` | Contract end | Yes |
| `setupFee` | One-time setup fee | No |
| `timeReportingRequiresStartStopTimes` | Require start/stop | No |
| `serviceLevelAgreementID` | SLA assignment | No |

### Contract Status

| ID | Status | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Active | Current, billable |
| 2 | Inactive | Suspended |
| 3 | Cancelled | Terminated |

### Service/Service Bundle

Services define what's included in a contract:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `serviceName` | Name of service |
| `unitPrice` | Price per unit |
| `unitCost` | Cost per unit |
| `periodType` | Monthly, Quarterly, Annual |
| `isOptional` | Required vs optional |

## API Patterns

### Creating a Contract

```http
POST /v1.0/Contracts
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "contractName": "Acme Corp - Managed Services",
  "companyID": 12345,
  "contractType": 1,
  "status": 1,
  "startDate": "2024-01-01",
  "endDate": "2024-12-31",
  "setupFee": 500.00,
  "timeReportingRequiresStartStopTimes": true,
  "serviceLevelAgreementID": 1
}
```

### Adding Services to Contract

```http
POST /v1.0/ContractServices
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "contractID": 54321,
  "serviceID": 111,
  "unitPrice": 150.00,
  "adjustedPrice": 150.00,
  "quantity": 50,
  "effectiveDate": "2024-01-01"
}
```

### Creating Block Hours Contract

```http
POST /v1.0/Contracts
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "contractName": "Acme Corp - Block Hours",
  "companyID": 12345,
  "contractType": 4,
  "status": 1,
  "startDate": "2024-01-01",
  "endDate": "2024-06-30"
}
```

Then add block hours:

```http
POST /v1.0/ContractBlocks
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "contractID": 54322,
  "datePurchased": "2024-01-01",
  "hoursPurchased": 40,
  "hourlyRate": 150.00,
  "isPaid": true
}
```

### Searching Contracts

**Active contracts for a company:**
```json
{
  "filter": [
    {"field": "companyID", "op": "eq", "value": 12345},
    {"field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": 1}
  ]
}
```

**Contracts expiring soon:**
```json
{
  "filter": [
    {"field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": 1},
    {"field": "endDate", "op": "lte", "value": "2024-03-31"},
    {"field": "endDate", "op": "gte", "value": "2024-01-01"}
  ]
}
```

### Checking Block Hour Balance

```http
GET /v1.0/ContractBlocks/query?search={"filter":[{"field":"contractID","op":"eq","value":54322}]}
```

Calculate remaining hours:
- Sum `hoursPurchased` - Sum of time entries against contract

### Renewing a Contract

1. Create new contract with updated dates
2. Copy services from old contract
3. Update old contract status to Inactive
4. Link any ongoing tickets to new contract

## Common Workflows

### Contract Setup

1. **Create contract**
   - Set type, dates, status
   - Assign SLA

2. **Add services**
   - Define included services
   - Set pricing and quantities

3. **Configure billing**
   - Invoice frequency
   - Payment terms

4. **Assign to tickets**
   - Set as default for company
   - Route work appropriately

### Contract Renewal

1. **Identify expiring contracts**
   - Query contracts by endDate
   - Generate renewal report

2. **Review contract performance**
   - Compare budgeted vs actual hours
   - Analyze profitability

3. **Negotiate renewal**
   - Adjust pricing if needed
   - Update service scope

4. **Create renewal**
   - New contract with new dates
   - Update company default contract

### Block Hours Management

1. **Monitor balance**
   - Track hours remaining
   - Alert at threshold (e.g., 10 hours)

2. **Replenish as needed**
   - Add new block purchase
   - Invoice for new hours

3. **Handle overages**
   - Bill at T&M rate
   - Or convert to new block

## Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

Contracts can be linked to SLAs:

| SLA Metric | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Response Time | Time to first response |
| Resolution Time | Time to resolve |
| Uptime | System availability % |
| Business Hours | When SLA applies |

SLA violations trigger alerts and can affect contract terms.

## Error Handling

### Common API Errors

| Code | Message | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| 400 | Invalid contract type | Use valid contract type ID |
| 400 | EndDate before StartDate | Fix date sequence |
| 409 | Cannot modify - has billing | Adjust dates only |
| 404 | ServiceID not found | Verify service exists |

### Validation Errors

**"CompanyID is required"** - Must associate with a company

**"StartDate is required"** - All contracts need start date

**"Invalid service for contract type"** - Service must match contract type

## Best Practices

1. **Name consistently** - "Company - Contract Type" format
2. **Set end dates** - Never leave end date empty
3. **Review renewals** - Quarterly expiration review
4. **Track profitability** - Compare budgeted vs actual
5. **Document terms** - Note special conditions
6. **Alert on block hours** - Proactive replenishment
7. **Assign SLAs** - Define service expectations
8. **Audit regularly** - Ensure tickets use correct contracts
