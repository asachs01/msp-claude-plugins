# Log Time Entry in Autotask

Log time worked against a ticket or project for billing and resource tracking.

## Prerequisites

- Valid Autotask API credentials configured
- Ticket or project must exist in Autotask
- User must have time entry permissions
- Resource record must be linked to API user

## Steps

1. **Resolve target entity**
   - If starts with "T" (e.g., T20240215.0001), look up ticket ID
   - If numeric, determine if ticket or project
   - If project, optionally resolve task ID

2. **Validate hours**
   - Ensure positive numeric value
   - Round to nearest quarter hour (0.25)
   - Warn if hours > 8 (overtime)
   - Block if hours > 24

3. **Determine billability**
   - Check explicit --billable flag
   - Check billing code billability
   - Check contract terms
   - Default based on work type

4. **Check budget limits**
   - Query project/contract budget status
   - Warn if at 90%+ of budget
   - Require approval if exceeding budget

5. **Get billing rate**
   - Check contract rate
   - Check resource rate
   - Check role rate
   - Apply default rate

6. **Create time entry**
   ```json
   POST /v1.0/TimeEntries
   {
     "ticketID": <resolved_ticket_id>,
     "resourceID": <current_resource_id>,
     "dateWorked": "<date>",

     "billingCodeID": <resolved_billing_code>,
     "isBillable": <billable_status>,
     "approvalStatus": <0_or_1>
