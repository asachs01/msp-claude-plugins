## API Operations

### Create Company

```http
POST /company/companies
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "identifier": "ACME",
  "name": "Acme Corporation",
  "status": {"id": 1},
  "type": {"id": 1},
  "addressLine1": "123 Main Street",
  "city": "Springfield",
  "state": "IL",
  "zip": "62701",
  "phoneNumber": "555-123-4567",
  "website": "https://www.acme.com"
}
```

### Get Company

```http
GET /company/companies/{id}
```

### Get Company by Identifier

```http
GET /company/companies?conditions=identifier="ACME"
```

### Update Company

```http
PATCH /company/companies/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "phoneNumber": "555-987-6543",
  "status": {"id": 1}
}
```

### Search Companies

```http
GET /company/companies?conditions=name contains "Acme" and status/id=1
```

### Delete Company

```http
DELETE /company/companies/{id}
```

**Note:** Deleting a company with related records (tickets, contacts, etc.) will fail. Use status change to Inactive instead.

## Common Query Patterns

**Active clients:**
```
conditions=status/id=1 and type/id=1
```

**Companies by territory:**
```
conditions=territory/id=5
```

**Companies with no contact:**
```
conditions=defaultContact=null
```

**Recently added companies:**
```
conditions=_info/lastUpdated>[2024-01-01]
orderBy=_info/lastUpdated desc
```

**Search by name:**
```
conditions=name contains "tech"
```

**Companies by market:**
```
conditions=market/id=3
```

## Company Relationships

### Parent/Child Companies

Companies can have hierarchical relationships:

```http
GET /company/companies/{id}/managedDevicesIntegrations
```

### Related Entities

| Entity | Relationship |
|--------|-------------|
| Contacts | `/company/contacts?conditions=company/id={id}` |
| Tickets | `/service/tickets?conditions=company/id={id}` |
| Agreements | `/finance/agreements?conditions=company/id={id}` |
| Projects | `/project/projects?conditions=company/id={id}` |
| Configurations | `/company/configurations?conditions=company/id={id}` |

## Best Practices

1. **Use unique identifiers** - Keep short, meaningful codes (ACME, ABC123)
2. **Standardize company names** - Consistent naming helps searching
3. **Set company type** - Enables filtering and reporting
4. **Add default contact** - Primary point of contact for communications
5. **Configure sites** - Multiple locations need separate sites
6. **Use custom fields** - Store industry-specific data
7. **Keep status current** - Inactive companies should be marked as such
8. **Link to accounting** - Set accountNumber for integration

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Identifier required | Missing identifier | Provide unique company code |
| Name required | Missing company name | Include name field |
| Identifier exists | Duplicate identifier | Choose unique identifier |
| Cannot delete | Has related records | Set status to Inactive instead |
| Invalid status | Status doesn't exist | Query statuses endpoint |
