## Best Practices

1. **Log time promptly** - Enter time daily, not at end of week
2. **Be specific in notes** - Document what was done for invoice clarity
3. **Use correct work type** - Important for accurate billing rates
4. **Set appropriate work role** - Affects billing rate
5. **Mark non-billable correctly** - Don't inflate billable hours
6. **Use charge codes** - For internal time tracking
7. **Submit time sheets** - Follow approval workflow
8. **Review before approval** - Verify accuracy before submitting

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| chargeToId required | Missing ticket/project ID | Include chargeToId |
| member required | Missing member reference | Include `member: {id: x}` |
| timeStart required | Missing start time | Include timeStart field |
| Invalid work type | Work type doesn't exist | Query workTypes endpoint |
| Cannot delete | Time already billed | Cannot delete billed entries |
| Invalid status | Invalid status value | Use Open, Approved, Rejected |
